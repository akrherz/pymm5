NOTES ON HOW TO INSTALL MM5 I/O PYTHON INTERFACE (pymm5)

This package contains just ascii script files, so no compilation is
needed (a python compilation is performed, but in the python sense).

Lots of packages are pre-requisite to this:

 1) NetCDF Library ( http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf )
     Version > 3.4, Tested on 3.4 (Most recent, on November 2000 3.5 avail.)
 2) Udunits Library ( http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/udunits )
     Version > 1.11.7, Tested on 1.11.7 (Most recent)

 3) Python ( http://www.python.org )
     Version > 1.52, Tested on 1.52 (Actually most recent is 2.0)
 4) Python netcdf interface ( http://snow.cit.cornell.edu/noon/ncmodule.html )
     Version dated 8/21/97, Tested on 8/21/97 (Most recent)
 5) Numerical Python ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy )
     Version > 17.0, Tested on 17.0 (Most recent, see bugs for COMPAQ/OSF)
 6) Python Imaging Library ( http://www.pythonware.com )
     Version > 1.1, Tested on 1.1 (Actually most recent is 1.1.1)

I will assume that You have successfully installed all this. (It will take
a two or three day of work to do this. I will not give any hints except to
follow install notes on each package, and install them in the order I
suggest).

Ok, You have managed to arrive to this point.

Having all this work done, You would like now to use this software.

The installation procedure is very easy.

      Launch (as root if needed) the install.py program.

   I.E.: python install.py

And answer the questions.

Good Luck. Graziano
